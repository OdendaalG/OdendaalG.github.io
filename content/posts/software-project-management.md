# Introduction
Throughout all of the projects I've been working on and led, a common theme has been arising: they all fall behind or fall flat.

What do I think that a project manager should have done on the projects:
- Stopped scope creep in the sense that check integration APIs and make sure that the client had finished building their part of the project before we started.
- Call out any slippage and track that indicating that 'hey, we lost X days here and its because we had to wait for Y and Z took longer because of A'.
