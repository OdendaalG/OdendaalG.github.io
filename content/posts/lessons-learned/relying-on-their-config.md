# What happened?
We had to demo the final version of an application that was in theory done, but the configuration that designs flow of the application was not nearly done. Let's call this config `product config`.

# Context
We were brought in to build a dynamic website that would display specific questions based off of a configuration backend. The issue is we have to build the application and they have to give us a configuration file that will tell us how to render specific questions.
